# Trailing & Leading Edge AC Light Dimmer

This PCB design is capable of dimming light bulbs using **trailing** and leading edge phase cut technology.
This allows to dim incandescent as well as most LED light bulbs.

Note that in this design, the dim level is manually controlled via an 500k Ohm rheostat.
For dimming incandescent light bulbs via software, an 8-channel leading edge dimmer design is available in this repository.
