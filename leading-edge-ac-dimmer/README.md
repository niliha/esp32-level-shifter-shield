# Leading Edge 230V AC Dimmer

This PCB design allows to dim 8 incandescent light bulbs using a microcontroller.

**Note:** In version v0.1 there is a design error which leads to arcing on the snubber resistor.
This can be fixed by omitting the snubber circuit at the cost of not being able to drive inductive loads.
In a future revision, the snubber resistor will be replaced with a more suitable one.
