# WS28XX Signal Booster

Allows to transmit up to 2 WS28XX data signals over long distances (up to 50m when GND and DATA are close together) while protecting the microcontroller pin or LED chip from sourcing too much current.
This PCB embeds an `IXDD604PI` gate driver IC acting as high-current line driver.
Further details can be derived from the [datasheet](https://ixapps.ixys.com/DataSheet/IXD_604.pdf).
